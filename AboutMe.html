<h1>About Matt</h1>
		
<p>My name is Matthew, but I prefer to just be called Matt. I like music, playing games, being social, & hope to get into fitness.</p>
<p>I mainly stay inside all day because I don't get invited anywhere and I found myself to be very lazy. I love to take naps every day because I tend to get tired very easily; but that's mainly due to my poor diet. </p>
<h2>I live in New York City</h2>
<img src="new york city.jpeg" width="500" height= "300">
<h3>Personally, life in NYC hasn't been so great for me. I'm not fond of the rowdiness in the cityâ€”and I live in a bad area, which doesn't help me enjoy the city any more. I'd like to live in a wealthier area and preferrably not in NYC when I get older, as I've already lived here my whole life and wish to see the world</h3>
<h2>When I'm Older</h2>
<p>I hope to have a lot of passive income to compensate for my laziness as I don't think I would be able to survive a 9-5 job my whole life. I also want to travel a lot to make up for my uneventful childhood growing up. I would like to live a fun and happy life without the worry of money.
</p>
